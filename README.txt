Basic Setup
--------------

Clone from GitHub using the command "git clone https://github.com/GregDucq/Portfolio-Website.git"

Rename the folder that is created "Apache24" and move it to the root directory.

If the PATH environment variable does not already include directories for php and sqlite3, and these two directories to the PATH variable and restart your computer:
	"C:\Apache24\php"
	"C:\Apache24\sqlite3"

Optional: Set up httpd.exe in Apache/bin directory as a service. Otherwise, run httpd.exe and then open localhost in a web browser to check if everything is working.
